# 🚀 Project Camp Backend

> A production-grade RESTful API for collaborative project management with secure authentication, role-based access control, and scalable architecture.

Project Camp Backend is a **real-world backend system** built to demonstrate how modern products handle authentication, authorization, project collaboration, and structured data flow. It is designed with **clean architecture, security best practices, and scalability** in mind.

---

## ✨ Why Project Camp?

Most backend projects stop at basic CRUD. **Project Camp goes beyond that**.

This project focuses on:

- 🔐 **Complete authentication lifecycle** (email verification, refresh tokens, password reset)
- 🛡️ **Strict role-based access control (RBAC)**
- 🧠 **Real project workflows** (projects → tasks → subtasks → notes)
- 📦 **File uploads & metadata handling**
- 🧩 **Extensible, production-style API design**

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- JWT-based authentication (access + refresh tokens)
- Email verification flow
- Forgot & reset password system
- Secure password change
- Protected routes with middleware

### 👥 Role-Based Access Control

Three-tier permission system:

- **Admin** – Full system control
- **Project Admin** – Project-level task control
- **Member** – Task & subtask updates

### 📁 Project Management

- Create, update & delete projects
- View accessible projects with member details
- Admin-only project lifecycle control

### ✅ Task & Subtask Management
